All the competitive important coding questions are solved using my own approach

KMP: Knutt-Morris-Pratt algorithm is an algorithm to find out whether a given pattern also exists in a given text(string) or not. The runTime is O(n)

RomanToInteger: program to find out the number equivalent of given roman number in string.
